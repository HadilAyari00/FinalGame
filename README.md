Space Invaders


As I am a fan of classic old-school arcade games, I developed a game inspired by the classic arcade game Space Invaders. It consists of three levels and the objective is to defeat waves of aliens to advance to the next level. The game features both old and new elements.


Old features:
* A player class that allows the player to move side to side. the player originally was able to move anywhere, but that made the game too hard so I restricted his mouvement like in the original game.
* An alien class representing the monsters that must be defeated. The aliens were originally represented by squares but now have their own images.
* Movement for the aliens, which used to be random across the screen.
* The ability for the player to shoot and defeat the aliens by making them disappear when hit by a bullet.
* The aliens shooting back at the player, the player used to die as soon as he got hit by an enemy bullet.


New features:
* The aliens move in waves rather than independently
* The aliens now move slowly down across the screen rather than randomly
* Obstacles that bullets cannot pass through.
* An end condition for the game if the aliens reach the bottom of the screen.
* Lives for the player, who now has 3 lives and visual hearts to keep track of them.
* added levels, with each level speed and number or invaders increase
* Invaders and final boss are now represented by images from the original game.
* Player has been replaced with a spaceship image.
* A score that increases each time an alien is defeated.
* Obstacles get smaller in the last level to make it harder
* A final boss that appears in the last level and has 100 hit points, kill the final boss and win the game !

extra features:
* A theme song and various sound effects for shooting, being hit, game over, and winning.
* Visual effects when the player is hit or aliens are defeated, as well as background stars. //followed a tutorial from a talented github individual
* A pixel font to match the arcade theme.
